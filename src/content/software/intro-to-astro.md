Astro is a modern web framework optimized for content-heavy websites.  
It focuses on performance by delivering zero JavaScript to the browser by default.

You can mix and match React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks within the same project — making Astro flexible yet minimal.

Astro’s guiding principle: **Ship less JavaScript.**
